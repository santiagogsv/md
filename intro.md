# Minimal Markdown Viewer

A clean, single file Markdown reader with a built in table of contents and drag and drop support. Use it as a quick previewer for notes, docs, or scratch files.

## Quick Start

- Drag and drop a .md file into the page
- Or click the + button to open a file
- The table of contents updates automatically

## Features

- Table of contents with anchor links
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Drag and drop file loading
- Local file picker via the + button
- Clean typography and readable spacing

## Markdown Support

This viewer supports common Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown features like:

- Headings and lists
- Code blocks and inline code
- Tables and task lists
- Links and blockquotes

Example code block:

```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## Math Support (KaTeX)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Block math:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Another example:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

## Tips

- Use meaningful headings so the table of contents is useful.
- Drop another file at any time to swap content.

## Done

You are ready to load your own Markdown files.
