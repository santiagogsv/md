# Product Notes Draft

These are longer notes to help test scrolling, repeated headings, and deep sections.

## Context

We are building a minimal markdown viewer. The UI should stay calm while the content does the heavy lifting.

### Goals

- Load local markdown files quickly
- Generate a clear TOC
- Keep the interface light and focused

### Non‑Goals

- Full Markdown editor
- Heavy theming
- Complex navigation

## Research

A few findings from quick testing:

1. Drag and drop should always work.
2. Click‑to‑open should be obvious but not intrusive.
3. The TOC should stay readable with long documents.

## Draft Outline

### Section 1: Experience

The user should be able to open a document with a single action and begin reading immediately. A clean layout with stable spacing encourages focus.

### Section 2: Structure

Headings should be obvious and the TOC should mirror them without extra decoration. Large documents need a predictable rhythm.

### Section 3: Performance

Parsing should feel instant for typical markdown files. If a file is large, the interface should remain responsive.

## Example Data

Here is a sample table:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drag/Drop | Done | Works in the sidebar |
| Click Open | Done | Only when empty |
| TOC | Done | Simple list |

## Block Quote

> Simplicity is not the goal. It is the by‑product of a good idea and modest expectations.

## Longer Paragraph

This paragraph stretches over several sentences to test long‑form readability. The best design here is to keep the line length short enough to be comfortable, while still making the most of the screen. The page should breathe.

## Additional Sections

### Appendix A

Extra notes and reminders. Keep the content flowing to test scroll momentum and anchor jumps.

### Appendix B

Another chunk of content. Make sure the TOC still feels stable and that the anchors land cleanly.

### Appendix C

Final filler for good measure.

## Wrap‑Up

End of the second sample file. Try dropping this on the sidebar to compare it against the first sample.
