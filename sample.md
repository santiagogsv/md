# Minimal Markdown Viewer

This is a longer sample document to test layout, spacing, and the table of contents.

## Overview

The goal is to keep everything plain, readable, and distraction‑free. The viewer should feel like a native macOS app page: clean, quiet, and easy to scan.

### What This Page Tests

- Basic headings and hierarchy
- Paragraph spacing
- Lists and nested lists
- Code blocks
- Links and emphasis

## Notes On Style

A minimal interface should still feel intentional. Good typography and spacing are enough. This text exists to help you stress‑test the rhythm of the page.

### Short List

- White space matters
- Gray is enough
- Defaults should feel good

### Nested List

- First level
  - Second level
    - Third level

## Code Sample

Here is a simple JavaScript function:

```
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
```

### Inline Code

Use `inline code` for small references.

## Links

You can link to sections or external sites.

## Tables And Tasks

Here is a GitHub-style table:

| Feature | Syntax | Supported | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| Tables | Pipes | Yes | Requires GFM |
| Task lists | [ ] [x] | Yes | Works in Marked |
| Strikethrough | ~~text~~ | Yes | Also GFM |

Task list sample:

- [x] Render headings
- [x] Render tables
- [ ] Render math

Strikethrough example: ~~remove this text~~

## Math (KaTeX)

Inline math: $E=mc^2$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Block math:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

More math:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

Matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Quote

> Markdown is a small language with big reach.

## Long Text Block

This paragraph is intentionally longer to test line length and readability. It should wrap comfortably and avoid feeling cramped. If it feels too dense, reduce the max width or adjust line height. The goal is a calm reading experience.

## Another Section

More content here so the TOC has enough entries to scroll.

### Subsection A

Some extra filler text. Keep scanning and scrolling to see how the page behaves.

### Subsection B

Even more content. The viewer should be responsive and stable.

## Conclusion

That is all for this sample. Drop another file to compare.
